This is a reactive router for Angular 2. It started as a fork of [react-router](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router) and shares a similar philosophy towards routing. It exposes an Rx-based API with multiple middleware entry points.

Please note that we are currently pre-v1.0. While we believe the core of the router is solid, you can expect a few breaking changes as we work towards a beta release. These early releases are meant to gather feedback from the community and to help with the direction of the router.
